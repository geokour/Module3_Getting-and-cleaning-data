# Code Book

This code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data in the tidy dataset generated by the `run_analysis.R` script.

## Dataset Source

The data used in this project comes from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, which was collected from the accelerometers of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones during various activities. The full description of the dataset can be found here:

The dataset can be downloaded from this link:

## Variables

The tidy dataset contains the following variables:

- `SubjectNum`: An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment (integer values ranging from 1 to 30).
- `Activity`: The type of activity performed by the subject when the measurements were taken. There are six possible activities:
  - WALKING
  - WALKING_UPSTAIRS
  - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  - SITTING
  - STANDING
  - LAYING
- The remaining columns are the average values of different features extracted from the original dataset, grouped by subject and activity. The features are normalized and bounded within [-1, 1]. They include the following measurements:
  - `tBodyAccMeanX`
  - `tBodyAccMeanY`
  - `tBodyAccMeanZ`
  - `tBodyAccStdDevX`
  - `tBodyAccStdDevY`
  - `tBodyAccStdDevZ`
  - ...

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

The `run_analysis.R` script performs the following data cleaning and transformation steps:

1. Downloads and unzips the dataset.
2. Reads the activity labels, features, train, and test datasets.
3. Extracts only the mean and standard deviation measurements from the features.
4. Merges the train and test datasets.
5. Adds descriptive activity names and subject identifiers to the merged dataset.
6. Creates a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
7. Writes the tidy dataset to a file named "tidy_data.txt".
