# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones - Tidy Dataset

This repository contains the R script and documentation files for the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" dataset tidy version. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set, with the goal of preparing a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

## Dataset

The data used in this project comes from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, which was collected from the accelerometers of Samsung Galaxy S II smartphones during various activities. The full description of the dataset can be found here:

The dataset can be downloaded from this link:

## Files

- `run_analysis.R`: This R script is used to create the tidy dataset. The script performs the following steps:
  1. Downloads and unzips the dataset.
  2. Reads the activity labels, features, train, and test datasets.
  3. Extracts only the mean and standard deviation measurements from the features.
  4. Merges the train and test datasets.
  5. Adds descriptive activity names and subject identifiers to the merged dataset.
  6. Creates a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  7. Writes the tidy dataset to a file named "tidy_data.txt".

- `CodeBook.md`: This code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data in the tidy dataset generated by the `run_analysis.R` script.

- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and describes the contents of the repository.

## Instructions

1. Download the `run_analysis.R` script to a folder on your local machine.
2. Set the working directory in R or RStudio to the folder where you saved the `run_analysis.R` file.
3. Install the required packages if you haven't already, by running: `install.packages(c("dplyr", "reshape2"))`.
4. Run the `run_analysis.R` script by typing `source("run_analysis.R")` in the R console.
5. The script will download and process the data, generating the "tidy_data.txt" file in the working directory.

## Tidy Dataset

The output of the `run_analysis.R` script is a tidy dataset named "tidy_data.txt". This dataset contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the original Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset.
